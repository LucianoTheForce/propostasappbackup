# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"ALMA 2026" is a sophisticated brand proposal website built with Next.js, featuring immersive 3D elements, advanced text animations, and audio interactions. It's a creative showcase for THE FORCE agency's visual identity and club room design proposal for ALMA 2026.

## Development Approach: Deploy-First Development ðŸš€

**Recommended workflow**: Skip local development and test directly on Vercel's deployed environment for faster iteration and real-world performance testing.

### Why Deploy-First for ALMA 2026?
- **3D Performance Testing**: WebGL and Three.js performance varies significantly between local and production
- **Audio System Validation**: Spatial audio and sound effects need real browser environment testing
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Immediate testing on mobile devices and different browsers
- **Real Performance Metrics**: Actual loading times and 3D rendering performance

## Development Commands

### Deploy-First Commands (Recommended)
```bash
# Quick deploy after changes
git add .
git commit -m "update: [description]"
git push

# Install Vercel CLI for manual deploys
npm install -g vercel

# Manual deploy for testing
vercel

# Production deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Traditional Local Development (Alternative)
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks

**Note**: Local development may not accurately represent 3D performance, audio behavior, or mobile interactions.

### Package Management
- Uses `pnpm` package manager (pnpm-lock.yaml present)
- Dependencies managed in package.json

## Vercel Configuration

The project includes optimized Vercel configuration (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install", 
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

### Environment Variables for Vercel
Set these in Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables:
- Any API keys for external services
- Production domain configurations
- Audio file CDN URLs if applicable

## Deploy-First Development Workflow

### 1. Code â†’ Deploy â†’ Test Cycle
1. **Edit Locally**: Make changes to 3D scenes, animations, or audio
2. **Push to Deploy**: `git push` triggers automatic Vercel deployment
3. **Test Live**: Use Vercel preview URL to test on real devices
4. **Iterate**: Immediate feedback on performance and interactions

### 2. Testing 3D Elements
- **Physics Interactions**: Test cannon.js physics on actual touch devices
- **Performance**: Monitor frame rates and WebGL performance  
- **Cross-Browser**: Ensure Three.js compatibility across browsers
- **Mobile Touch**: Validate touch interactions with 3D monad component

### 3. Audio System Testing
- **Spatial Audio**: Test positional audio in real browser environment
- **Touch Feedback**: Validate audio triggers on mobile devices
- **Performance**: Check audio loading and playback performance

## Architecture & Key Technologies

### Framework & UI
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom configurations
- **Shadcn/ui** components library integration
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **GSAP** with ScrollTrigger for advanced animations

### 3D Graphics & Effects
- **React Three Fiber** (@react-three/fiber) for 3D scenes
- **React Three Drei** (@react-three/drei) for 3D utilities
- **Three.js** for WebGL rendering
- **Postprocessing** effects (Bloom, ChromaticAberration)
- **Cannon.js** physics engine for interactions

### Audio System
- Custom audio management with sound effects
- Spatial audio positioning based on 3D interactions
- Touch and mouse interaction sound feedback

### Styling Architecture
- Custom CSS variables in Tailwind config
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom typography using Inter font family
- CSS-in-JS with Emotion for specific components

## Component Structure

### Custom Components (`/components/`)
- **3D Scene**: `three-js-scene.tsx` - Main 3D interactive component with physics
- **Animations**: `advanced-text-animation.tsx` - Multi-type text animation system
- **Audio**: `audio-player.tsx`, `audio-control.tsx` - Audio management
- **Interactive**: `magnetic-element.tsx`, `cursor-effect.tsx` - Mouse interactions
- **UI Components**: Extensive shadcn/ui component library in `/components/ui/`

### Main Application
- **App Router**: `/app/page.tsx` - Single-page application with multiple sections
- **Layout**: `/app/layout.tsx` - Global layout and metadata
- **Styles**: `/app/globals.css` - Global styles and CSS variables

## Development Guidelines

### Code Conventions
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D components
- Handle browser compatibility (SSR-safe components)

### Performance Considerations
- 3D components are client-side only (`"use client"`)
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- WebGL context cleanup and error handling
- Responsive 3D rendering with performance optimization
- Frame rate limiting and demand-based rendering

### Browser Support
- WebGL detection and fallback handling
- Touch device detection for mobile optimization
- Progressive enhancement for 3D features
- Error boundaries for graceful degradation

## Build Configuration

### Next.js Config (`next.config.mjs`)
- ESLint errors ignored during builds
- TypeScript errors ignored during builds
- Unoptimized images for better compatibility

### Special Features
- Interactive 3D "Monad" component with physics-based rotation
- Multi-language content (Portuguese/English)
- Sophisticated animation system with GSAP and Framer Motion
- Audio-reactive elements
- Custom cursor effects
- Magnetic hover interactions

## Development Notes
- Extensive use of refs for DOM manipulation
- Custom easing functions and animation patterns
- Physics-based interactions with touch/mouse support
- Complex state management for 3D scene interactions
- Audio system integrated with visual feedback
